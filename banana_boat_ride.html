        <p>Banana Boat Rides are one the funniest Water Sports in Goa. An inflatable boat resembling the shape of a
            banana is
            used for Banana Boat Rides in Goa. This boat is linked to a speed boat. 4 to 6 people can be seated in one
            banana
            boat. The boat throws off the passengers as soon as the speed boat sprints across the sea. Sometimes, you
            would find
            yourself being flung into the water even before you have hardly started off the beach. After being thrown
            into the
            surf, the passengers pull themselves back into the banana boat and start afresh. It isa repetitive process
            of
            getting flung into the sea and then hauling yourself back to the banana boat. This is an ensured fun
            sport!<br><br> The banana boat can accommodate up to 10 people. If you’re a fun seeker, the banana boat ride is
            the kind of activity for you. Adults and teens will enjoy the excitement it brings. Even if you don’t know
            how to swim, you can still participate in the banana boat ride. You just need to wear a life jacket to
            ensure safety. The life jacket will be provided by the banana boat provider.
