        <p>Would you like to fly up in the air just like the superhero you see in Marvel comics and then within a span
            of a few minutes swim like a dolphin? Well as incredible and dreamy as it sounds, you surely can do that in
            your very own Goa. Flyboarding in Goa is a new set of innovation in extreme water sports that takes
            adventure to a whole new level. The flyboard is a quite unique device which becomes one with your personal
            water craft and reaches new heights both above and below the water’s surface. How it attaches to the
            enthusiast is similar to a wakeboard. The power on the device comes from the jet ski which is controlled by
            throttle. Your instructor will always be able to monitor how you are doing and adjust the power (or thrust)
            your flyboard receives. This helps to make sure the experience is safe and geared to your comfort
            level.<br><br>Contrary to popular belief they are actually quite simple to learn how to use. If properly
            trained, most people pick up how to operate one in 5 minutes or less. In less than half an hour, most
            completely grasp how to use their flyboard and, of course, have a great deal of fun. The fun only gets
            better with more practice as people learn just how much they can do on a flyboard. From simply speeding
            along the water to diving underneath and learning new tricks to send them spinning around, there is really
            no limit for anyone.

        <ol>
            <li>Not recommended for pregnant women, people with heart ailments or serious medical conditions.</li>
            <br><br>

            <li>Surfers need lots of arm and leg strength. They should have a strong back support and posture</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>Most first time flyers flare around when they first try out the board, which is expected and anticipated
                by the instructors. It’s common to wave your arms around to “balance,” however, anything from your waist
                up has no impact on flying. When a flyer learns to control their arms, it makes their experience that
                much more enjoyable.</li><br><br>
            <li>Upon jumping into the water, you are given a coast guard approved life vest and a helmet. You now float
                without having to try. When you are put into the bindings and strapped to the Flyboard, you still
                float.Many people think that they will sink if something goes wrong and are nervous because they are
                strapped to the board. The board and rider both float, allowing the rider to relax in the water when
                they are not flying.</li><br><br>
            <li>You go as high as up to 30 ft. in the air and dive under the water and then shoot up and swim like a
                dolphin.</li><br>
