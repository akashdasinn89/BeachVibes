<h1><u>KAYAKING</u></h1>
<div class="gen">
<img style="border:3px solid black;" src="./pictures/t11.jpg"><br>

<p>Kayaking is the use of a kayak for moving over water. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation.Kayaking can be peaceful and meditative or can be exhilarating – depending on where and how you do it.There are many types of kayaks used in flat water and whitewater kayaking. The sizes and shapes vary drastically depending on what type of water to be paddled on and also what the paddler would like to do. The second set of essentials for kayaking is an off-set paddle where the paddle blades are tilted to help reduce wind resistance while the other blade is being used in the water. These vary in length and also shape depending on the intended use, height of the paddler, and the paddler's preference. Kayaks should be equipped with one or more buoyancy aid (also called flotation) which creates air space that helps prevent a kayak from sinking when filled with water. A life jacket should be worn at all times (also called a personal flotation device or PFD), and a helmet is also often required for most kayaking and is mandatory for white water kayaking. Various other pieces of safety gear include a whistle for signaling for help; throwing ropes to help rescue other kayakers; and, a diving knife and appropriate water shoes should used depending upon the risks the water and terrain pose. Proper clothing such as a dry suit, wetsuit or spray top also help protect kayakers from cold water or air temperatures.</div></p><br><br><br><br>
