<p>Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving where the diver uses an apparatus which is completely independent of surface supply to breathe underwater.[1] The name "scuba", an acronym of "Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus", was first used by Christian J. Lambertsen in a patent submitted in 1952. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air,[2] allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied divers, and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold divers.[1] Although the use of compressed air is common, a mixture of air and oxygen called enriched air or nitrox has become popular due to its benefit of reduced nitrogen intake during long or repetitive dives. Breathing gas diluted with helium may be used to reduce nitrogen narcosis.
Open circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled, and consist of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a diving regulator. They may include additional cylinders for range extension, decompression gas or emergency breathing gas .[3] Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. Rebreathers extend the time spent underwater compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption; they produce fewer bubbles and less noise than open circuit scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.[1]
Scuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in a number of applications, including scientific, military and public safety roles, but most commercial diving uses surface-supplied diving equipment when this is practicable. Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers.</p><br><br><br><br></div>

<b><u>HIGHLIGHTS</u></b><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>While being underwater, your body is exposed to a pressure gradient. All your body muscles are working simultaneously and require oxygen to do so, so your blood vessels open in order to bring that oxygen to the muscles.</li><br><br>
<li>By simultaneously keeping your balance while swimming with paying attention to your environment, your brain improves its concentration and awareness.</li><br><br>
<li>The warming up of our body plus the slow and deep breaths used whilst diving, help to reduce our blood pressure. Many studies show that those who dive regularly are less likely to be prone to strokes and heart attacks.</li><br><br>
<li>Diving brings you closer to nature, literally and figuratively speaking. Divers tend to appreciate nature more than non-divers would and are most excited to feel part of the underwater world.</li><br><br>
<li>Diving also improves our self-perception due to the fact that scuba diving happens in an environment that is different from ours – the sea – and being able to handle it makes you feel confident and fulfilled!</li><br><br>
<li>You need to be a reasonably proficient swimmer and comfortable in the water. You must  able to swim a distance of 200 metres, without a time or specific stroke requirement. You’ll also perform a 10 minute tread/float during a swim test before or during the course.</li><br><br>
<li>Lung problems (such as a collapsed lung or asthma), ear issues (such as problems with ear equalization), allergies, and certain diseases are all potentially dangerous underwater. Some medications are contraindicated for diving. Divers should carefully read, and then honestly answer the diving medical questionnaire before beginning to dive, and they should review it periodically throughout their diving careers. </li><br><br>
